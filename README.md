# Demo project: Codeship Pro + AWS CodeDeploy + Docker + Chef

This is a demo project demonstrating and making use of the following:

- CodeShip Pro
- AWS CodeDeploy + Docker
- Chef
- Terraform

We will be deploying a demo web application (written in Golang, but that doesn't matter) as
a docker container using CodeShip Pro's native integration with AWS CodeDeploy. Instead of
writing shell scripts (Bash, Powershell), we will be using [chef](https://www.chef.io/configuration-management/) cookbooks to deploy
our application.

The sub-directories in this repo are described next.
